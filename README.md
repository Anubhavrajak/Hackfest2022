**Goal of our project**

The primary goal of the project is to leverage recent  developments  in  smart  water  technologies  to  detectand  reduce  water  leakages  in  large  water  distribution  networks  with  the  aid  of  neural  networks. We  have  developed two different models, the first model is based on Artificial NeuralNetworks (ANNs) which not give the desired accurecy. The second  model  is  based  on convolutional NeuralNetworks (CNNs) .  CNNS model able  to  correctly  classify  the  leak nodes with good accuracy, The  Multi-Layer  Perceptron  model  outperforms  the Self Organizing Maps model,
